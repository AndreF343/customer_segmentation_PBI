# customer_segmentation_PBI

[image_placeholder]

The notebook in this repository examines customer behavior patterns in an e-commerce dataset from a UK-based online retail company. The dataset spans December 2010 to December 2011, containing over 500,000 transactions from approximately 4,000 customers across 38 countries. The analysis can be viewed in either notebook or html format.

I have also included a screenshot of a PowerBI dashboard on the data. Due to having PBI Free, I cannot share the dashboard directly.
